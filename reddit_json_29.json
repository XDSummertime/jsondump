I deleted the post from this community but I made a similar post in another community and I am gonna share that link just for context. I have managed to make some progress and I have secured admission to an American university for a short term course and I am now eligible to apply for a study visa. My husband knows that I don&#39;t want to be with him so he doesn&#39;t want me in USA as he knows I am gonna divorce him as soon as I am in a safe place. He has been harrasing my family to let me move in to his house in my home country and my family has almost given in to his request and they have told him that when he will come to visit in the next 3-4 months, they will send me to his house to stay with him. I am extremely scared as now he knows that I don&#39;t like him and he is gonna try everything to break me. I know he&#39;s gonna rape me and force me to have babies with him. My family won&#39;t let me get a divorce so I really need to get out of here before he comes back. I can&#39;t apply in any other country for now because my family won&#39;t allow me and USA is the only country that they will let me travel to since my husband lives there. Now I am gonna apply for an F1 visa and I am scared that it will get rejected due to me being married to an American citizen. My husband doesn&#39;t know that I am applying and I don&#39;t plan on telling him either. If I do get the visa, I am gonna divorce him as soon as I get to USA. But how do I convince the interviewer that I don&#39;t have any intentions of applying for adjustment of status? Can I tell him/her about my situation? I&#39;m extremely anxious as I feel like this is my last chance of getting out and avoiding a life long abusive situation. Please guide me as to how can I secure an F1 visa in this situation.
